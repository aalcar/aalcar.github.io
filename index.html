      I'm a rising freshman in the University of California system studying Computer Science :D.
      I'm interested in cryptography and may decide to major in Applied Mathematics alongside my Computer Science major.
      Or I may switch into a Computer Science & Engineering degree.

      Just focusing on Computer Science-esque topics can be boring. I have other interests in reading, <a href="https://aalcar.github.io/cubes">speedcubing</a>, and going on
      walks with my dogs.
