<h3>About Me:</h3>

<li>Male</li>
<li>17</li>
<li>Student</li>

<p>
  I'm a rising freshman in the University of California system studying Computer Science :).
  I'm interested in cryptography and may decide to major in Applied Mathematics alongside my Computer Science major.
  Or I may switch into a Computer Science & Engineering degree.
</p>
<p>
  Just focusing on Computer Science-esque topics can be boring. I have other interests in reading, speedcubing, and going on
  walks with my dogs.
